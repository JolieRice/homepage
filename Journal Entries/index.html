          </h2>
          <p>
            Reading Schwulst’s “What is a Website” completely reshaped how I
            think about the internet as a creative space. As a graphic design
            major, I’m used to thinking about layout, typography, and branding,
            but Schwulst encourages seeing websites as personal, poetic, and
            even alive. I appreciated how she compared websites to gardens,
            temples, and playgrounds, it reminded me that websites don’t have to
            be rigid grids of content. They can feel like zines, diaries, or
            pieces of art. This text made me more excited about the
            possibilities of handmade web design, especially how it can reflect
            personal identity or mood in ways that templates and standardized
            platforms often can’t. It also made me want to slow down and
            consider the tone and “spirit” of the sites I make, not just the
            function.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Carpenter’s writing really emphasized the value of imperfection and
            intimacy in web design. I often feel pressure to make things look
            polished and professional, but this text reminded me that the web
            can also be a place for experimentation and personal expression. I
            liked how Carpenter tied the handmade web to zine culture,
            prioritizing the maker's voice over commercial slickness. It was
            refreshing to hear someone argue for websites that feel human and
            unique, especially in contrast to the sameness of social media and
            template driven design. This reading encouraged me to think of my
            code as craft, and that even small choices can carry meaning.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Choi’s essay made me think more deeply about the connection between
            code and community. I often approach websites as visual systems, but
            this reading emphasized the importance of the people behind the
            screens, their intentions, accessibility needs, and how they
            experience technology. Choi’s inclusive and patient approach to
            teaching code reminded me that handmade web work doesn’t have to be
            intimidating, it can be slow, collaborative, and rooted in care. I
            also loved the small, playful illustrations throughout the piece,
            they added warmth and personality, and showed how visual elements
            can support storytelling in a way that feels human. It reminded me
            that design can be both simple and expressive, even in the context
            of coding.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Reading A Friend is Writing felt less like reading and more like
            eavesdropping on a collective thought process. The overlapping
            messages popping up across the screen created a sense of urgency,
            chaos, and connection all at once. I’m used to thinking about
            clarity and hierarchy, but this experience challenged that. It felt
            intentionally disorienting, like the format was mimicking the noise
            of constant digital communication. I started to think about how
            design can be used not just to organize content, but to evoke
            emotion and reflect social realities. The web doesn’t always have to
            be clean and linear, it can feel like a crowded room or a
            conversation thread. This reading reminded me that storytelling
            online doesn’t have to follow a single voice or direction. It can be
            messy, collaborative, and alive.

          <p>
            This piece made me reflect on how digital spaces are starting to
            mirror the values of the DIY and back-to-the-land movements,
            rejecting mass production in favor of something slower, smaller, and
            more intentional. I often feel caught between wanting to make
            polished, professional work and craving a more personal, expressive
            way of creating. Abbe’s writing made it clear that there’s a growing
            desire to reclaim the web as a place for community, experimentation,
            and self-reliance, much like a handmade object. It’s inspiring to
            see how people are building their own sites as alternatives to
            corporate platforms. This article encouraged me to think about my
            own web presence as a kind of digital home, something I can shape,
            decorate, and share on my own terms.

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            Chimero’s metaphor of the web as a “room” really stuck with me. It
            made me think about how we design online spaces not just to display
            information, but to make people feel welcomed, curious, and
            inspired. I’m always considering layout and visual flow, but this
            essay pushed me to think more about mood and atmosphere. What kind
            of “room” am I creating when I build a site? Is it cozy, open,
            cluttered, cold? Chimero’s critique of how the internet has shifted
            toward utility over beauty made me reflect on how handmade, personal
            sites can reintroduce a sense of care and presence. It reminded me
            that design isn't just about solving problems, it’s also about
            creating meaningful experiences, and sometimes, simply making space
            for people to exist and explore.
